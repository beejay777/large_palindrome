Algorithm for the program.


1. assign two variables to 999 (largest 3 digit number)
2. loop from 999 to 0 and nest the same loop second time decresing corresponding value at a time.
3. multiply current values. 
4. if the value is palindrome return the value
5. else decrease the values and run same login until any value is returned or program ends.
